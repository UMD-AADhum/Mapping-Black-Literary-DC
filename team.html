                      <p class="col fs-4">Mapping Black Literary DC is a digital exploration of Black literary spaces from 1980 to 2010. A non-exhaustive representation, MBLDC seeks to preserve the city’s rich cultural and spatial histories by highlighting the lineage of places, people, and publications that have allowed Black literary communities to flourish. MBLDC synthesizes data from ephemera, publications, oral histories, and images available in local archival collections to highlight the legacy of DC’s Black literary communities and their contributions to the cultural richness of the city and beyond.</p>
