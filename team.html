                      <p class="col fs-4">Mapping Black Literary DC seeks to preserve the city’s rich African American and Afro-Atlantic histories by combining data from records from across the District’s wide-ranging archival collections to present an immersive and interactive digital exploration of Black literary spaces from 1980 to 2010. At the cross section of digital archival and curatorial practice, visual arts, and digital humanities, MBLDC synthesizes data from ephemera, Black and LGBTQ+ publications, oral histories, and images to highlight the legacy of D.C.’s Black literary communities and their contributions to the cultural richness of the city and beyond.</p>
